This proved, far more difficult, than imagined. Altering one thing would throw out the balance of another.\n\nAt the moment, the gameplay is still in early stages.\nAll rules are configurable, so one can create their own game within limitations.\nAfter some more work, I would publish this version.\nWith the intent to hopefully find the best version of the rules with the feedback.\n\nEarly on, I tried to find ways to build the game without using text, which wasn't feasible.\nI may revisit this idea. I would love to make the game so otherworldly that every second with it feels alienating. And forgoing a normalcy such as text would certainly work towards this alienation.\n\nAfter telling some of my colleagues about the game, one noted how much it sounded like a simple fighting game.\nI was surprised by that comparison, but they were completely right.\nOwing to me having absolutely no experience with fighting games, I didn't see the obvious comparison."
